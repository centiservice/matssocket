                     * messages stored for this MatsSocketSession. So, the point is that if we've got notified about
                     * several messages while doing the rounds, we've EITHER already handled them in one of the loop
                     * rounds, OR one final pass would handle any remaining. We can thus set the count down to 1, and be
                     * sure that we will have handled any outstanding messages that we've been notified about /until
                     * now/.
                     *
                     * Example: If two more messages came in while we were doing these at-the-time final rounds, the
                     * count would be increased to 3. The messages would either be swept in the rounds currently
                     * running, or not. But the count is 3, so when we come here, we reduce it to 1, and do a sweep,
                     * either then not finding any messages (since they were already swept), or picking those two up and
                     * forward them - and then reduce from 1 to 0 and exit. This argument holds forever..!

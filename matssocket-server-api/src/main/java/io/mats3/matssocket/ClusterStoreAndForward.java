/**
 * MatsSockets forwards requests from WebSocket-connected clients to a Mats Endpoint, and must get the reply back to the
 * client. The WebSocket is "static" in that it is a fixed connection to one specific node (as long as the connection is
 * up), which means that we need to get the message back to the same node that fired off the request. We could have used
 * the same logic as with MatsFuturizer (i.e. the "last jump" uses a node-specific Topic), but that was deemed too
 * feeble: We want reliable messaging all the way to the client. We want to be able to handle that the client looses the
 * connection (e.g. sitting on a train which drives through a tunnel), and thus will reconnect. He might not come back
 * to the same server as last time. We also want to be able to reboot any server (typically deploy of new code) at any
 * time, but this obviously kills all WebSockets that are attached to it. To be able to ensure reliable messaging for
 * MatsSockets, we need to employ a "store and forward" logic: When the reply comes in, which as with standard Mats
 * logic can happen on any node in the cluster of nodes handling this Endpoint Stage, the reply message is temporarily
 * stored in some reliable storage. We then look up which node that currently holds the MatsSession, and notify it about
 * new messages for that session. This node gets the notice, finds the now local MatsSession, and forwards the message.
 * Note that it is possible that the node getting the reply, and the node which holds the WebSocket/MatsSession, is the
 * same node, in which case it eventually results in a local forward.
 * <p/>
 * Each node has his own instance of this class, connected to the same backing datastore.
 * <p/>
 * It is assumed that the consumption of messages for a session is done single threaded, on one node only. That is, only
 * one thread on one node will actually {@link #getMessagesFromOutbox(String, int)} get messages}, and, more
 * importantly, {@link #outboxMessagesComplete(String, Collection) register them as completed}. Wrt. multiple nodes,
 * this argument still holds, since only one node can hold a MatsSocketSession - the one that has the actual WebSocket
 * connection. I believe it is possible to construct a bad async situation here (connect to one node, authenticate, get
 * SessionId, immediately disconnect and perform reconnect, and do this until the current {@link ClusterStoreAndForward}
 * has the wrong idea of which node holds the Session) but this should at most result in the client screwing up for
 * himself (not getting messages). A Session is not registered until the client has authenticated, so this will never
 * lead to information leakage to other users. Such a situation will also resolve if the client again performs a
 * non-malicious reconnect. It is the server that constructs and holds SessionIds: A client cannot itself force the
 * server side to create a Session or SessionId - it can only reconnect to an existing SessionId that it was given
 * earlier.

/**
 * The MatsSocket Java library, along with its several clients libraries, is a WebSocket-"extension" of the Mats library
 * <i>(there are currently clients for JavaScript (web and Node.js) and Dart (Dart and Flutter))</i>. It provides for
 * asynchronous communications between a Client and a MatsSocketServer using WebSockets, which again asynchronously
 * interfaces with the Mats API. The result is a simple programming model on the client, providing Mats's asynchronous
 * and guaranteed delivery aspects all the way from the client, to the server, and back, and indeed the other way
 * ("push", including requests from Server to Client). It is a clearly demarcated solution in that it only utilizes the
 * API of the Mats library and the API of the <i>JSR 356 WebSocket API for Java</i> (with some optional hooks that
 * typically will be implemented using the Servlet API, but any HTTP server implementation can be employed).
 * MatsSocketEndpoints are simple to define, code and reason about, simple to authenticate and authorize, and the
 * interface with Mats is very simple, yet flexible.
 * <p/>
 * Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Very lightweight transport protocol, which is human readable and understandable, with little overhead
 * ({@link MessageType all message types} and {@link MatsSocketCloseCodes all socket closure modes}).</li>
 * <li>A TraceId is created on the Client, sent with the client call, through the MatsSocketServer, all the way through
 * all Mats stages, back to the Reply - logged along all the steps.</li>
 * <li>Provides "Send" and "Request" features both Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client.</li>
 * <li>Reconnection in face of broken connections is handled by the Client library, with full feedback solution to the
 * end user via event listeners</li>
 * <li>Guaranteed delivery both ways, also in face of reconnects at any point, employing an "outbox" and "inbox" on both
 * sides, with a three-way handshake protocol for each "information bearing message": Message, acknowledge of message,
 * acknowledge of acknowledge.</li>
 * <li>Client side Event Listener for ConnectionEvents (e.g. connecting, waiting, session_established, lost_connection),
 * for display to end user.</li>
 * <li>Client side Event Listener for SessionClosedEvents, which is when the system does not manage to keep the
 * guarantees in face of adverse situation on the server side (typically lost database connection in a bad spot).</li>
 * <li>Pipelining of messages, which is automatic (i.e. delay of 2 ms after last message enqueued before the pipeline is
 * sent) - but with optional "flush()" command to send a pipeline right away.</li>
 * <li>Several debugging features in the protocol (full round-trip TraceId, comprehensive logging, and
 * {@link DebugOption DebugOptions})</li>
 * <li>Built-in and simple statistics gathering on the client.</li>
 * <li>Simple and straight-forward, yet comprehensive and mandatory, authentication model employing a
 * MatsSocketServer-wide server {@link AuthenticationPlugin} paired with a Client authentication callback, and a
 * per-MatsSocketEndpoint, per-message {@link IncomingAuthorizationAndAdapter IncomingAuthorizationAndAdapter}.</li>
 * <li>The WebSocket protocol itself has built-in "per-message" compression.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>There is no way to cancel or otherwise control individual messages: The library's simple "send" and
 * Promise-yielding "request" operations (with optional "receivedCallback" for the client) is the only way to talk with
 * the library. When those methods returns, the operation is queued, and will be transferred to the other side ASAP.
 * This works like magic for short and medium messages, but does not constitute a fantastic solution for large payloads
 * over bad networks (as typically <i>can</i> be the case with Web apps and mobile apps).</li>
 * <li>MatsSockets does not provide "channel multiplexing", meaning that one message (or pipeline of messages) will have
 * to be fully transferred before the next one is. This means that if you decide to send over a 200 MB PDF using the
 * MatsSocket instance over a 2G cellular network, any subsequent messages issued in the same direction will experience
 * a massive delay - i.e. MatsSocket is susceptible to <i>head of line blocking</i>. This again means that you should
 * probably not do such large transfers over MatsSocket: Either you should do such a download or upload using ordinary
 * HTTP solutions (which can go concurrent with MatsSocket's WebSocket), or employ a secondary MatsSocket instance for
 * such larger message if you just cannot get enough of the MatsSocket API - but you would still get more control over
 * e.g. progress and cancellation of the transfer with the HTTP approach.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <b>WARNING! Please make absolutely certain that you understand that incoming messages to MatsSocketEndpoints
 * originate directly from the hostile Internet, and you cannot assume that any values are benign - they might be
 * specifically tailored to hack or crash your system. Act and code accordingly! It is imperative that you NEVER rely on
 * information from the incoming message to determine which user to act as: It would e.g. be absolutely crazy to rely on
 * a parameter in an incoming DTO declaring "userId" when deciding which user to place an order for, or to withdraw
 * money from. Such information must be gotten by the authenticated elements, which are
 * {@link MatsSocketEndpointIncomingContext#getPrincipal() incomingContext.getPrincipal()} and
 * {@link MatsSocketEndpointIncomingContext#getUserId() incomingContext.getUserId()}. The same holds for authorization
 * of access: If the incoming DTO from the Client demands to see <i>'top secret folder'</i>, you cannot rely on this,
 * even though you filtered which elements the user can request in a <i>'folders you are allowed to access'</i>-list in
 * a previous message to the Client. The user handling the Client could just hack the request DTO to request the top
 * secret folder even though this was not present in the list of allowed folders. You must therefore again authorize
 * that the requesting user actually has access to the folder he requests before returning it.</b> This is obviously
 * exactly the same as for any other transport, e.g. HTTP: It is just to point out that MatsSocket doesn't magically
 * relieve you from doing proper validation and authorization of incoming message.

     * MatsSocket Endpoint expects. On serialization, the message object is serialized separately from the Envelope -
     * and then plugged into the Envelope on the 'msg' field using a "direct JSON" technique.
     * <p/>
     * Note: When instances of this the Envelope DTO is exposed via the MatsSocket API via listeners or the
     * {@link LiveMatsSocketSession#getLastEnvelopes() LiveMatsSocketSession.getLastEnvelopes()}, the contents of the
     * 'msg' will always be a String representing the JSON serialized message - it will NOT be an instance of a DTO
     * class. This ensures that the entire Envelope can be sent as a Mats or MatsSocket message, should that be of
     * interest. <b>Also, exposed Envelopes will be as instances of {@link MatsSocketEnvelopeWithMetaDto
     * MatsSocketEnvelopeWithMetaDto}!</b>.
     * <p/>

     * {@link MatsSocketEnvelopeWithMetaDto MatsSocketEnvelopeWithMetaDto} and including it in the source of another

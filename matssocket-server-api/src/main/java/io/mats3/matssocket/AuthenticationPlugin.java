         * argue that the same arguments hold: This {@code SessionAuthenticator} was happy with the authentication some
         * few minutes ago and the connection has not broken in the meantime, so you should work pretty hard to set up a
         * situation where a REQUEST from the Server or some data using SEND from the Server would be a large security

         * {@link AuthenticationContext#invalidAuthentication(String) invalidAuthentication()} (and thus the client will

         * actual expiry time of the token in {@link #reevaluateAuthentication(AuthenticationContext, String, Principal)
         * reevaluateAuthentication(..)}, and if the token is the same with this invocation, just evaluate the expiry

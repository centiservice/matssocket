///
///   * Client MessageId  (envelope's 'cmid').
///   * Timestamp of when message was sent.
///   * Target MatsSocket Endpoint or Terminator Id  (envelope's 'eid').
///   * TraceId for the SEND or REQUEST  (envelope's 'tid').
///   * The outgoing message, i.e. the SEND or the REQUEST message  (envelope's 'msg').
///   * Experienced Received Acknowledge round-trip time.
///   * For [MatsSocket.request], the Reply's [MessageEventType]

///   to [MatsSocket.initiations], and then all [InitiationProcessedEvent] listeners are invoked
/// * request/requestReplyTo: First [ReceivedEvent] is issued (i.e. ack/nack). Then, when the reply
///   comes back to the server, an [InitiationProcessedEvent] is added to [MatsSocket.initiations], and
///   then all [InitiationProcessedEvent] listeners are invoked, and finally the [MessageEvent] is
///   delivered, either as settling of the return Reply-Promise (for 'request'), or invocation of the Terminator's
///   message- or rejectCallbacks (for 'requestReplyTo').

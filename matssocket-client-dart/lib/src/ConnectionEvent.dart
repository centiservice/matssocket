/// [ConnectionEventType.CONNECTING] and
/// [ConnectionEventType.SESSION_ESTABLISHED]. However, for events where the client is
/// "reacting", e.g. when the WebSocket connects, or abruptly closes, they are issued ASAP when the Client gets to know about it:
/// [ConnectionEventType.CONNECTED], [ConnectionEventType.LOST_CONNECTION],
/// [ConnectionEventType.CONNECTION_ERROR] and [ConnectionEventType.WAITING].
/// For [ConnectionEventType.COUNTDOWN], there is not much to say wrt. timing, other than you won't typically
/// get a 'countdown'-event with 0 seconds left, as that is when we transition into 'connecting' again. For events
/// that also describe [ConnectionState]s, the [MatsSocket.state] is updated before the event is fired.

  /// 356 WebSocket API for Java sends GOING_AWAY upon socket close <i>due to timeout</i>. Since a timeout can
  /// happen if we loose connection and thus can't convey PINGs, the MatsSocketServer must not interpret Jetty's
  /// timeout-close as Close Session. Likewise, if the client just experienced massive lag on the connection, and
  /// thus didn't get the PING over to the server in a timely fashion, but then suddenly gets Jetty's timeout close
  /// with GOING_AWAY, this should not be interpreted by the client as the server wants to close the

  /// * From Client/Browser: Used when the client closes WebSocket "on purpose", wanting to close the session -

  /// MatsSocketSession are effectively deleted from the server, including any undelivered replies and messages
  /// ("push") from server.
  /// * From Server: `MatsSocketServer.closeSession(String)` was invoked, and the WebSocket to that client

  /// HELLO:RECONNECT was attempted, but the session was gone. A considerable amount of time has probably gone by

  /// view of the world, thus the suggestion of "reboot".
  SESSION_LOST,

  /// 4002: Both from Server side and from Client/Browser side: REISSUE all outstanding upon reconnect:
  /// * From Client: The client just fancied a little break (just as if lost connection in a tunnel), used from
  /// integration tests.
  /// * From Server: We ask that the client reconnects. This gets us a clean state and in particular new
  /// authentication (In case of using OAuth/OIDC tokens, the client is expected to fetch a fresh token from token
  /// server).

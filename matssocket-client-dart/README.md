# MatsSocket client in Dart, compatible with Flutter

MatsSocket is a WebSocket-based client-server solution which bridges the asynchronous message based nature of [Mats<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3) all the way out to your end user client applications, featuring bidirectional communication. It consists of a small MatsSocketServer API which is implemented on top of the _Mats<sup>3</sup> API_ and _JSR 356 Java API for WebSockets_ (which most Servlet Containers implement), as well as client libraries - for which there currently exists JavaScript and Dart/Flutter implementations.
